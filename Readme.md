# Welcome to the CrackHead Project!

Greetings, fellow programmer! Welcome to the CrackHead project, application that uses advanced machine learning techniques to find the most relevant images based on your query. It's like having a personal assistant who understands your needs and finds the perfect match for you. But wait, there's more!

## What's the CrackHead Project?

It's a Python-based application that uses the power of OpenAI's CLIP model to find the most relevant images based on your query. Whether you're looking for a specific object, person, or even a meme, our application has got you covered!

## How does it work?

It works on 1's and 0's. 

## Why CrackHead?

Well, why not? Go ahead and give it a try!

## Getting Started

To get started with the CrackHead project, you'll need to clone this repository and install the required dependencies. Once you've done that, you can run the `app.py` script to start the application.
